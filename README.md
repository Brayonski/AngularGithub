## Introduction to angular

__Angular__ can be a challenge to get grips of, mostly because of the combination of __hard syntax__, __nested elements__ and the __large number of files__ you work with.

The purpose of this week's content at Moringa was to introduce us to the world of __framework environments__.

Angular is essentially a framework that allows developers to manipulate CSS, HTML & jS smoothly and efficiently.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The layout of the web-app

My web-app, called __Quote-Bender__ was developed using Angular.
It contains three components:
1. *profile component * -

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### profile components
Contains the main data (parent). It holds the main visual structure of the website in it's HTML & CSS.
